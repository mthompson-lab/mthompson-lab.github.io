Today, the Thompson Lab celebrated Zahra’s successful defense. Our very first Master’s student to graduate! Over the past year, Zahra contributed to an exciting collaborative project with Dr. Roberto Chica’s lab at the University of Ottawa, exploring protein structure-function relationships in engineered enzymes. Her paper is coming out soon, so stay tuned!
Congratulations, Zahra! we’re so proud of you!
