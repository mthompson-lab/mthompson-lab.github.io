We're proud to celebrate our outstanding undergraduate researcher, Edie Gollub, who received the CBC Department’s Undergraduate Research Excellence Award! Edie spent two years in Dr. Shahar Sukenik’s lab at UC Merced before joining our lab in 2024, where she made a tremendous impact. She’s now headed to graduate school at UC San Diego, and we couldn’t be more excited for her next chapter. Congratulations, Edie. Keep shining!
