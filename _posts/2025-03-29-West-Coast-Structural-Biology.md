Our lab had the opportunity to attend this year’s West Coast Structural Biology Meeting at Asilomar in Pacific Grove, which was a truly enriching experience! The week was filled with inspiring scientific talks, new connections with researchers from across the country, and the chance for many of our lab members to present their work.

Dr. Wolff presented his exciting research on temperature-jump experiments with soybean lipoxygenases.

Alexander and Sarah presented a joint poster on cyclin-dependent kinase drug discovery.

Azeem presented his work on capturing the ferric structure of soybean lipoxygenases.

Behnoush gave a talk on her latest project exploring how new structural features emerge in engineered enzymes.

Edie presented a poster on her undergraduate research in Dr. Shahar Sukenik’s lab, focused on desiccation in intrinsically disordered proteins.

Josh presented a poster on his work with IRF3.

Luisa showcased her research on Cdc2-like kinases as natural thermometers.

It was a fun, collaborative, and productive week — and a great snapshot of the diverse science happening in structural biology around the US!
