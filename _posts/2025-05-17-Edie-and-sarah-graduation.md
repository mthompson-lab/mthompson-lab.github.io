Our two amazing undergraduates, Edie and Sarah, graduated this semester and walked in Saturday’s ceremony and Mike was there to cheer them on! We’re so proud of them and wish them all the best in their next steps. Edie is heading to UC San Diego for graduate school, and Sarah will be continuing with the Thompson lab this summer as a UROC scholar. Congratulations, Edie and Sarah!
