Today, our amazing undergraduate researcher, Sarah, presented her work at the UC Merced UROC (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center) Symposium! This semester, she worked alongside Luisa on an exciting crystallography project focused on CLK kinases. We were all thrilled to hear about her progress and contributions. Great job, Sarah! we’re proud of you!
